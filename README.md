This is my first project to fulfill assignment tasks from Bootcamp Data Science Dibimbing Batch 23B. Big thanks to Bayuzen Ahmad, Octavian Reksa and Pararawendy Indarjo as mentors to give me lesson, criticism and suggestions. I got this dataset from kaggle.

# **Analyze jobs in data fields that are most demand in America and Europe.**

# **Objective**
This data's survey start was 2020. At this time maybe still experiencing the Covid 19 pandemic, so this data was not optimal. Likewise, 2021 and 2022 are a period of recovery from the Covid 19 pandemic. 2023 there will be a huge increase in jobs in the data sector. This survey was conducted all over the world, but I will focus on countries in America and Europe.

# **Business Objective**
This research was conducted to analyze jobs in the data fields that are most in demand in America and Europe.

# **Libraries**

Libraries such as pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn are the most commonly used in the analysis. 

''' - import numpy as np 

import pandas as pd

import seaborn as sns

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

!pip install yellowbrick

from yellowbrick.cluster import SilhouetteVisualizer

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# **Result Preview**
By Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) I found if **Data Science and Research is the most popular from jobs in data, namely at 1655**.
